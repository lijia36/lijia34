            <p>Calories, defin as a unit of heat tp measure amount of energy in food. People calculate calories in food to pick what they eat, and also keep them in good shape. For example, people do workout to loss weight, so they usually eat about 1500 cals per day (adult). But at the same time, different ages, gender, height, and weight can control how much calories you are eating. As the 2 list, graph below.  </p>
